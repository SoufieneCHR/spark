# Spark provides this Travis CI configuration file to help contributors
# check Scala/Java style conformance and JDK7/8 compilation easily
# during their preparing pull requests.
#   - Scalastyle is executed during `maven install` implicitly.
#   - Java Checkstyle is executed by `lint-java`.
# See the related discussion here.

# 1. Choose OS (Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS Server Edition 64bit, ~2 CORE, 7.5GB RAM)
sudo: required
dist: trusty

# 2. Choose language, target JDKs, and tests for parallel builds
language: java
matrix:
  include:
  - jdk: oraclejdk7
    env: TEST_TO_RUN=lint-java
  - jdk: oraclejdk8
    env: TEST_TO_RUN=lint-scala
  - jdk: oraclejdk8
    env: TEST_TO_RUN=kubernetes-integration
    install: true # skips the install step

# 3. Setup cache directory for SBT and Maven.
cache:
  directories:
  - $HOME/.sbt
  - $HOME/.m2

# 4. Turn off notifications.
notifications:

# 5. Run maven install before running lint.
install:
  - export MAVEN_SKIP_RC=1
  - build/mvn -T 4 -q -DskipTests -Pmesos -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.3 -Pkubernetes -Pkinesis-asl -Phive -Phive-thriftserver install

# 6. Run test
script:
  - if [[ $TEST_TO_RUN == "lint-java" ]] ; then
      dev/lint-java;
    else
      echo "lint-java SKIPPED";
    fi
  - if [[ $TEST_TO_RUN == "lint-scala" ]] ; then
